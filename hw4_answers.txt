	The server gets the /wiki GET request. "app.py" parses this with routing. 
The routing function for "/wiki" calls a redirect using the flask module which 
tells the browser there is a 300 series redirect which prompts another GET 
request for the destination of "http://en.wikipedia.org" and then the browser 
returns that to the screen.

	GET / HTTP/1.1" 404
