 The HTTP command is "GET." app.py looks for the name in the request. It then saves it in a variable; that variable is then handed to the render function as an argument. When the sever renders, the HTML template (Jinja) will put the variable into the HTML document, ready to be rendered by the browser.

You can verify this change by looking at the Stored Wiki which returns Disney's website. This was implemented in the app.py file.
