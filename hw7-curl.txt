What’s the diﬀerence between Yelp’s 
homepage compressed and uncompressed?

Use curl - downloads items from internet
man curl to get help
-v: provide verbose output
-H: specify HTTP headers
>: redirect command output to ﬁle

ANSWER:
using the command:
curl -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" www.yelp.com > "output.txt"

and then this command:
du -h output.txt 

YIELDS
 24K	output.txt

Shows that the gzip encoded (compressed) file was only 24K

WHEREAS
using the command:
url www.yelp.com > "uncompressed-output.txt"

and then this command:
du -h uncompressed-output.txt 

YIELDS
 96K	uncompressed-output.txt

Which shows that the uncompressed yelp.com home page is 72k larger. The compressed version is 25% the size of the original.

And if you look at the time to compress the original, it's only 11 miliseconds:
$ time gzip uncompressed-output.txt 

real	0m0.011s
user	0m0.005s
sys	0m0.004s
